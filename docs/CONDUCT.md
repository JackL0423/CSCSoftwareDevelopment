# Team Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment
We, as members of this software development team, commit to fostering an open, collaborative, and respectful environment. 
We recognize that our success depends on trust, accountability, and shared responsibility. This document outlines our expectations for teamwork, communication, and professionalism.

---

## 1. Decision-Making
- **Process:** Decisions will be made collaboratively through **consensus** whenever possible. If consensus cannot be reached within a reasonable timeframe, a **majority vote** will determine the outcome.
- **Transparency:** All decisions must be documented in meeting notes or shared channels (e.g., Text, Discord, or email).
- **Disputes:** When disagreements arise, members agree to discuss them constructively and seek resolution through open dialogue.

---

## 2. Attendance
- **Expectations:** Members are expected to attend all scheduled meetings (virtual or in-person) unless prior notice is given.
- **Legitimate Reasons for Absence:** Illness, personal emergencies, or scheduling conflicts are acceptable with advance notice to the team.
- **Making Up Missed Meetings:** Absent members are responsible for reviewing shared meeting notes and communicating with peers to stay current on decisions and assignments.

---

## 3. Assignments
- **Distribution:** Tasks and deliverables will be assigned based on individual strengths, availability, and project needs, as agreed upon during meetings.
- **Accountability:** Each member is responsible for completing their assignments on time and to the team’s quality standards.
- **Incomplete Work:** If a member fails to complete or poorly completes an assignment, the issue will be addressed privately. Repeated issues will trigger a team discussion to reassign tasks or redistribute workload fairly.

---

## 4. Participation and Communication
- **Channels:** Communication will occur via the team’s designated platform (e.g., Slack, Discord, or Microsoft Teams). Major updates will also be documented in shared repositories or project management tools (e.g., GitHub Issues, Trello).
- **Inclusion:** Every member is encouraged to contribute their ideas and feedback. Efforts will be made to ensure quieter voices are heard.
- **Respecting Strengths:** Tasks will be aligned with each member’s technical strengths and interests when possible, while also encouraging skill development in new areas.

---

## 5. Meeting Times and Mediums
- **Scheduling:** Meeting times will be selected based on team-wide polls or shared availability calendars to ensure maximum participation.
- **Medium:** Meetings may be held via video call, in-person, or hybrid formats depending on project needs.
- **Adjustments:** If scheduling conflicts persist, asynchronous updates via shared documents or recorded briefings may be used.

---

## 6. Agendas, Notes, and Documentation
- **Agenda Preparation:** Meeting agendas will be shared at least 24 hours in advance by the facilitator or rotating lead.
- **Note Taking:** A designated note-taker (rotating each meeting) will record key decisions, action items, and deadlines.
- **Sharing Notes:** Notes will be stored in the team’s shared drive or repository within 24 hours after the meeting for review and accountability.

---

## 7. Promptness
- **Expectations:** Members should join meetings and submit deliverables on time.
- **Handling Lateness:** Members who are running late must notify the group. Chronic lateness will be addressed privately and may result in reassignment of responsibilities.

---

## 8. Conversational Courtesies
- **Active Listening:** Allow others to finish speaking before responding. Avoid interrupting or dominating conversations.
- **Balanced Airtime:** Everyone should have the opportunity to contribute equally.
- **Respectful Dialogue:** Disagreements are natural but must remain professional and focused on ideas, not individuals.
- **Focus:** Members will avoid unrelated tangents and stay on topic to ensure productive discussions.

---

## 9. Enforcement and Feedback
- **Rule Enforcement:** The team will hold each other accountable through mutual respect and direct, constructive communication.
- **Feedback Culture:** Feedback should be:
  - **Timely:** Given soon after the relevant event or deliverable.
  - **Specific:** Focused on behaviors or work output, not personalities.
  - **Actionable:** Including suggestions for improvement.
- **Escalation:** Persistent issues will be discussed in a group meeting, and if unresolved, elevated to a supervising instructor or project lead.

---

## 10. Acknowledgment
By participating in this project, each member agrees to uphold this Code of Conduct and actively contribute to a respectful and effective working environment.
