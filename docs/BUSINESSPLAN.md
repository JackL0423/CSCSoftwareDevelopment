# Lean Canvas – GlobalFlavors

---

## **Problem**
- Home cooks want authentic regional dishes but don’t know where to start or what’s truly authentic.  
- Turning a recipe into a shoppable cart is tedious; ingredients & lists are scattered across sites.  
- Local availability and culturally accurate substitutions—especially with dietary needs—are unclear.  
- Many cooks have a confidence gap in the kitchen; they want guided steps, time-frame estimates, and confirmations.

---

## **Solution**
- Country discovery → dish → curated recipe.  
- Recipe Search → type the name of a specific dish → detailed recipe appears.  
- One-tap grocery list generation + “Add Recipe to Grocery List” deep links.

---

## **Unique Value Proposition**
**Tagline:** *Discover Authentic Recipes from Around the World*  

**UVP:**  
Discover authentic regional dishes through simple, curated browsing and an easy, guided cooking experience.

---

## **Advantage**
- **Tasty / AllRecipes / Food Network** — large recipe libraries, but not region-first or authenticity-focused.  
- **NYT Cooking** — high-quality recipes but behind a paywall and not centered on cultural discovery.  
- **TikTok / Instagram creators** — great inspiration, but unverified recipes and no structured cooking mode.

---

## **Customer Segments**
- **Primary:** Adults 20–40 in 1–2 person households seeking authentic, weeknight-friendly meals.  
- **Secondary:** Travelers recreating dishes from abroad.  
- **Early Adopters:** Food-curious users who enjoy exploring global cuisine, trying new dishes, and prefer curated, visually guided cooking apps.

---

## **Revenue Streams (Monetization)**
- **In-app AdMob banner ads** displayed on the home screen across the bottom.  
- **Sponsored Featured Recipe Placement** (“Recommended Dish” highlight):  
  - Restaurants, cultural brands, or food creators can pay to have a dish featured in the Recommended or Featured section.  
  - Fits naturally with the existing curated homepage UI.  
- **(Optional V2)** Ad-free upgrade for a small fee.
