Observation 1:
Observation Statement:
Most responses suggest that users find a tool like this valuable and would likely benefit from its features.
Supporting Data:
In the “How valuable would each feature be to you?” section, responses showed strong interest in most features. The majority of participants rated ingredient-aware suggestions, automatic grocery lists, and portioning and leftovers planners as “very” or “extremely” valuable. In contrast, curated fitness and diet recipes received more mixed feedback but still reflected general interest.
Team Action (if any):
No action needed yet. The team will focus on developing and refining the most valued features first. Specifically the automatic grocery list generator, ingredient-aware substitution system, and portioning planner will have a higher focus to ensure they are highly functional and intuitive.
