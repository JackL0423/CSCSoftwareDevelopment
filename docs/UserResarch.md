# User Cooking Experience (Jack)

## Observation
45% percent of users described their cooking experience as intermediate which we defined as cooking weekly, and comfortable making substitutions to the recipe. 18% said they would describe themselves as confident cooks who frequently cook.

## Changes to App
The dev team did not think we needed to make any changes to our app. We plan on having a experience variable for the user profile that will allow for AI responses to be automatically geared towards their cooking skill.

## Observation (Sophia):
### Observation Statement:
Most responses suggest that users find a tool like this valuable and would likely benefit from its features.

## Supporting Data:
In the “How valuable would each feature be to you?” section, responses showed strong interest in most features. The majority of participants rated ingredient-aware suggestions, automatic grocery lists, and portioning and leftovers planners as “very” or “extremely” valuable. In contrast, curated fitness and diet recipes received more mixed feedback but still reflected general interest.

## Team Action (if any):
No action needed yet. The team will focus on developing and refining the most valued features first. Specifically, the automatic grocery list generator, ingredient-aware substitution system, and portioning planner will have a higher focus to ensure they are highly functional and intuitive.

## Observation (Maria)
**Observation Statement:**  
Many users expressed frustration with not having appropriate ingredient substitutions when cooking international recipes.

**Supporting Data:**  
For example, 45% of respondents selected "Substitutions when I’m missing ingredients / for international dishes" among their top cooking pain points. In an open-ended response, one user wrote:  
> “I often can’t find key spices, so I have to improvise or skip the recipe.”  

**Team Action (if any):**  
We will prioritize implementing a “smart substitution” feature in which the app suggests local equivalents for missing ingredients.
