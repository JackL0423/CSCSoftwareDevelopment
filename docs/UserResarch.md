# User Cooking Experience (Jack)

## Observation
45% percent of users described their cooking experience as intermediate which we defined as cooking weekly, and comfortable making substitutions to the recipe. 18% said they would describe themselves as confident cooks who frequently cook.

## Changes to App
The dev team did not think we needed to make any changes to our app. We plan on having a experience variable for the user profile that will allow for AI responses to be automatically geared towards their cooking skill.
